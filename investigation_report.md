# Supabase Database Investigation Report
## Page: termite-removal-2 on tuscaloosapestcontrol.net

**Date:** September 9, 2025  
**Investigation Goal:** Understand why "2 images replaced" was reported but no changes are visible on the frontend.

---

## Key Findings

### 1. Database Record Located
- **Record ID:** 274e1010-eb0b-4771-bc9b-956feb627957
- **Domain:** tuscaloosapestcontrol.net
- **Post Name:** termite-removal-2
- **URL:** https://tuscaloosapestcontrol.net/termite-removal-2/
- **Last Updated:** 2025-09-09T12:51:23.461991+00:00 (recently updated)

### 2. Image Data Analysis

#### Current pelementor_cached (Elementor Data):
- **Data Size:** 9,483 characters
- **Images Found:** 1 image
  - `http://tuscaloosapestcontrol.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/roof-repairs-montgomery-3.png`

#### Regolith Discovery Data (discovered_images_regolith):
- **Discovery Timestamp:** 2025-09-09T12:44:28.964Z
- **Total Images Found:** 2 images
- **Images Discovered:**
  1. **Background Image:** `http://tuscaloosapestcontrol.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/new-roof-construction-3.png`
     - Type: media_object
     - Context: container background
     - Path: [0].settings.background_image

  2. **Carousel Image:** `http://tuscaloosapestcontrol.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/roof-maintenance-check-3.png`
     - Type: media_object
     - Context: image-carousel widget
     - Path: [2].elements[0].elements[0].settings.carousel[0]

### 3. Critical Discrepancy Identified

**The Problem:** There's a mismatch between what the pelementor_cached field contains and what the regolith discovery found:

- **pelementor_cached contains:** `roof-repairs-montgomery-3.png`
- **regolith discovery found:** `new-roof-construction-3.png` and `roof-maintenance-check-3.png`

**This indicates one of the following:**
1. The regolith discovery data is stale and doesn't match the current Elementor data
2. The pelementor_cached field wasn't updated after the image replacements
3. The image replacement process failed to properly update the cached data

### 4. Live Page Status
- The live page is currently returning a 503 error (Service Unavailable)
- This prevents direct verification of what images are actually displayed

---

## Root Cause Analysis

Based on the code analysis of the `rhino-replace` system and the data discrepancies found:

### Most Likely Cause: Stale Regolith Data
The regolith discovery system identified images (`new-roof-construction-3.png` and `roof-maintenance-check-3.png`) that don't match what's currently in the pelementor_cached field (`roof-repairs-montgomery-3.png`).

The rhino-replace system includes stale regolith detection logic that triggers when less than 30% of regolith URLs match the current Elementor data. In this case:
- 0% of regolith URLs match the current data (0/2 images match)
- This should have triggered the stale regolith detection system

### Why the "2 Images Replaced" Message Occurred
The system likely:
1. Found 2 images in the regolith data
2. Attempted to replace them with new images
3. But the replacement failed because the URLs didn't exist in the current Elementor data
4. Still reported "2 images replaced" based on the upload count rather than actual replacements

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Re-run Image Discovery:** Execute the f331 regolith discovery API to refresh the discovered_images_regolith field with current data
2. **Verify Current Images:** Check what images are actually in the current pelementor_cached data
3. **Re-attempt Image Replacement:** Once regolith data is refreshed, retry the image replacement process

### API Endpoints to Use:
1. **Refresh Regolith Data:**
   ```
   POST /api/f331-discover-elementor-images-regolith
   Body: { "gconPieceId": "274e1010-eb0b-4771-bc9b-956feb627957" }
   ```

2. **Re-run Image Replacement:**
   ```
   POST /api/rhino-replace
   Body: {
     "gcon_piece_id": "274e1010-eb0b-4771-bc9b-956feb627957",
     "selected_plan_ids": [/* your plan IDs */],
     "batch_id": "/* your batch ID */",
     "sitespren_id": "/* sitespren ID */"
   }
   ```

### System Improvements Needed:
1. **Better Error Reporting:** The system should report actual replacements made, not just uploads completed
2. **Automatic Regolith Refresh:** When stale regolith is detected, the system should auto-refresh before attempting replacements
3. **Live Data Verification:** Before reporting success, verify that changes are actually visible on the live page

## Technical Details

### Database Fields Analyzed:
- `pelementor_cached`: Contains Elementor page data (9,483 chars)
- `discovered_images_regolith`: Contains image discovery data from f331 process
- `asn_sitespren_base`: tuscaloosapestcontrol.net
- `g_post_id`: WordPress post ID for API updates
- `updated_at`: Recently updated (0.1 hours ago)

### Image URLs Found:
**Current (pelementor_cached):**
- http://tuscaloosapestcontrol.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/roof-repairs-montgomery-3.png

**Regolith Discovery:**
- http://tuscaloosapestcontrol.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/new-roof-construction-3.png
- http://tuscaloosapestcontrol.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/roof-maintenance-check-3.png

### Live Page Accessibility:
- **Status:** 503 Service Unavailable
- **Impact:** Cannot verify frontend display of images
- **Recommendation:** Check server status or try again later

This investigation reveals that the image replacement process likely failed due to stale regolith data, but still reported success based on the upload phase rather than the actual replacement phase. The solution is to refresh the regolith discovery data and retry the replacement process.
