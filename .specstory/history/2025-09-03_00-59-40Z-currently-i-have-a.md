Here are the steps to change your domain from snef.me to app.tregnar.com:

## In Vercel Dashboard:
1. Go to your project settings
2. Navigate to "Domains" section
3. Add `app.tregnar.com` as a new domain
4. Remove `snef.me` from the domains list

## DNS Configuration:
1. In your DNS provider (where you manage tregnar.com):
   - Add a CNAME record: `app` pointing to `cname.vercel-dns.com`
   - Or add an A record: `app` pointing to Vercel's IP addresses

## Verification:
1. Vercel will verify domain ownership
2. SSL certificate will be automatically provisioned
3. Your app will be accessible at app.tregnar.com

The GitHub repo connection remains unchanged - Vercel will continue pulling from the same repository, just serving it on the new domain.
