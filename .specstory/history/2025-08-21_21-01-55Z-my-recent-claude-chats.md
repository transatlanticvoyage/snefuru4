_**User**_

my recent claude chats in iterm here are showing a double instance of the chat input area itself (with 1 being blank on top of the one that can actually be typed in). any idea why this is? 

very strange looking bug. probably related to iterm2 or claude code. im not sure. please advise me

This sounds like a display/rendering issue with Claude Code in iTerm2. Here are the most likely causes and solutions:

## Common Fixes:

1. **Clear terminal and restart Claude Code**:
   ```bash
   clear
   # Exit current Claude Code session (Ctrl+C or exit)
   # Restart Claude Code
   ```

2. **Check iTerm2 settings**:
   - Go to iTerm2 → Preferences → Profiles → Terminal
   - Ensure "Disable session-initiated window resizing" is unchecked
   - Try toggling "Use Unicode version 9 widths"

3. **Terminal size/resize issue**:
   ```bash
   # Reset terminal size
   resize
   # Or manually resize iTerm2 window
   ```

4. **iTerm2 profile conflicts**:
   - Try creating a new iTerm2 profile
   - Test Claude Code with default settings

5. **Clear iTerm2 scrollback**:
   - Cmd+K to clear scrollback buffer
   - Or Edit → Clear Buffer

## If issue persists:

- Try Claude Code in Terminal.app to isolate if it's iTerm2-specific
- Update iTerm2 to latest version
- Check if you have any iTerm2 plugins/scripts that might interfere
- Try `claude --version` to ensure you're on the latest Claude Code version

Which of these solutions would you like to try first?

<think><details>The user is asking if they need to restart Claude Code to fix the double input area issue. Given that this is likely a terminal rendering/display issue, restarting the program would be the first and most logical step to try. It's quick, easy, and often resolves these kinds of display glitches.</details></think>

Yes, definitely restart Claude Code first - that's the quickest fix to try.

Just exit the current session (Ctrl+C or type `exit`) and restart Claude Code. Terminal display bugs like duplicate input areas are usually resolved by restarting the program.

If restarting doesn't fix it, then we can try the other solutions I mentioned.
