please give me instructions to rotate and change all necessary supabase api keys and any other api keys that were currently using. please do not display the actual api key value in the chat but please do tell me the name of the key, line number, and file location and name in our repo where this type of info is currently stored (it could be in multiple .env files and even in other files potentially - i dont know) . i need to change it for security.

I'll help you find all API keys and credentials in your repository that need to be rotated. Let me search through your codebase to identify where these are stored.
