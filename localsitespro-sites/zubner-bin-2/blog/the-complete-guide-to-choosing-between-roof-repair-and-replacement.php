                <p>As a Kalamazoo homeowner, deciding between roof repair and replacement is one of the most significant maintenance decisions you'll face. At Kalamazoo Roofing Contractors, we've helped countless homeowners throughout <a href='/areas-we-serve/portage-'>Portage</a> and <a href='/areas-we-serve/richland-'>Richland</a> make this crucial choice. Let's explore how to make the right decision for your home.</p>

<h2>Signs You Might Need Roof Work</h2>
<ul>
<li>Shingles that are cracked, curled, or missing</li>
<li>Water stains on your ceiling</li>
<li>Daylight visible through roof boards</li>
<li>Sagging roof deck</li>
<li>Granules in gutters</li>
</ul>

<h2>When Repair Is The Right Choice</h2>
<p>Our <a href='/services/roof-repair'>roof repair services</a> might be your best option when:</p>
<ul>
<li>Damage is limited to a small area</li>
<li>Your roof is less than 15 years old</li>
<li>Most shingles are in good condition</li>
<li>You're planning to sell within 5 years</li>
</ul>

<h2>When to Consider Full Replacement</h2>
<p>Our experience with <a href='/services/roof-installation'>roof installation</a> shows that replacement is often better when:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your roof is over 20 years old</li>
<li>Multiple leaks exist across the roof</li>
<li>More than 30% of the roof is damaged</li>
<li>You want to increase home value</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cost Considerations for Kalamazoo Homeowners</h3>
<p>While repairs might seem more budget-friendly initially, they're not always the most cost-effective long-term solution.
