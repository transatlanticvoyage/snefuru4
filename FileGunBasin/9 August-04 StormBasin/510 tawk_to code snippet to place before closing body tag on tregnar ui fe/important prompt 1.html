please place a 16 px bold text piece that says
transit_table

place this text above the very beginning of the dp1, etc. table (outside the table - just before it as a "label" - appearing visually above the left top corner of the table)

then next, please focus on the 2 columns for dp5 in the new ui table 

please focus on the "C" cell in the table which means "copy"

please do not place any buttons new elements inside the table in terms of its contents on the frontend

we just need the text there and nothing else saying tings like "C" or "xls", etc. 

when user clicks anywhere on the "C" table cell under dp5 , walrus, please run the same function that is currently triggered by the /planchjar page on the /dpackjar tab when usr clicks "sharkintax - equal signs and hyphens" button in the row for dpack_id "5" for the associated site stored in the url parameter. 

on /driggsman, when user clicks on this button to "C" to clipboard, user will copy to clipboard all of the text that would be triggered to appear in the nozzle popup when the user performs the action described above
