pleae create the db schema for 2 different ddb tables that we need new


they will be called:
callplat_companies
callplat_accounts

their structure should mirror the naming conventions and relationship patterns of existing db tables:
host_company
host_account





then pleaes create new page at 
/cplatzar

make this page mimick the entire look and function of the /hacctjar2 page 

we do not need a field called domains_glacier in the sql for callplat_accounts

we need a field called:
phone_numbers_glacier

that mimicks it in concept and in functionailty in the main big text box below the ui table grid (along with the fetch glacier button that accompanies it)

in this case it will use the api of nimbata, ringba, twilio, etc. to fetch a list of phone numbers the user has in that account on that call platform
