create new page

select cncglub rows to populate |
kw style | type root of kw (city_name) (state_code)
Select kwslot to populate |  kwslot1 , kwslot2, etc
rel_dfs_location_code |

Run 370 populate kwslot* in cncglub


———————————————————————
this process will:

create new keywords in db table keywordshub (if they do not exist)

create kw style by referring to cncglub -> cncglub.rel_city_id -> cities.city_name / cities.state_code

tag all kws with a special tag (including ones that did previously exist(if any) that match the criteria set here)
