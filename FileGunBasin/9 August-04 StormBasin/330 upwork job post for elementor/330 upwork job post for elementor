Emulate Competitor Site's Design Into Elementor Blocks Builder Manually



I want to essentially create a copy of the design of a competitor site about plumbing. It's a local lead generation site that I will message your the URL of.

I will provide you with the WP login to a dev site where I have Elementor, Generatepress installed.

I know I'm not using the same theme as the example site, but I don't think it matters (I think they're using Astra).

Your job is to build manually inside my wp install, a site that looks basically exactly like what they have in terms of its design and we will fill it out with dummy content etc.

I need somebody that knows how to use Elementor to really create everything and mimick the design details that they have.

I'm trying to create a WP template site that looks like this site.
