summary of how the f370 function should work

user will "run" this function by pressing button on /fabric page

it must show user a double warning popup that this is a signficant process and they must confirm 2 times
———————————————————————
———————————————————————

the gist of what will happen:

———————————————————————
• identify all db rows in db table cncglub that match the criteria in these options

cncglub option - select country
cncglub option - select industry
cncglub option - select cities

please note that country and cities options here are related to db columns that exist in db table cities

these must be filtered through a relationship field in cncglub that connects the foreign key to the cities db table

and the same for the industry option (which corresponds to industries db table - which also has foreign key relationship field in cncglub db table)


———————————————————————
• create new keywords in db table keywordshub (if they do not exist)

• create a new tag in keywordshub_tags db table

———————————————————————
• tag all kws with a special tag (including ones that did previously exist(if any)  and didn't have to be created because they match the criteria set here)

the criteria I'm referring to is a match to the options of:

kwhub option - kw rubric (the end output after dynamic short codes are rendered into end-text)
kwhub option - rel_dfs_location_code
kwhub option - language_code

———————————————————————

next, populate the field cncglub.kwslot* (the asterisk corresponds to "kwslot option - kwslot to populate") with the keyword_id number for the keyword that was created related to that specific cncglub row
