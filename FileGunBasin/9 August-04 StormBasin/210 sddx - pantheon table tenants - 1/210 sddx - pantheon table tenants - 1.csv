SPECIAL NOTE TO CLAUDE CODE: the intention of this file is the following:,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"I will create a table below. The first row where there are no cells containing anything other than a ""///"" marks the beginning of the table's <thead> area",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"The second row where there are no cells containing anything other than a ""///"" marks the end of the table's </thead> area and the beginning of the table's <tbody> area",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"The third row where there are no cells containing anything other than a ""///"" marks the end of the table's </tbody> area and the end of the table's area overall (</table>)",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"Please note: this ui table may contain multiple header rows (<tr> rows inside its <thead> area), that's why I wanted to define my markup definition distinctly to you here.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"your job, as claude code, is to, when manually commanded by me in chat, review this interface table model that I will edit here in the spreadsheet overtime, and you should be able to understand what I'm trying to represent to you regarding a desired table ",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
this desired interface table is currently going to be located at 2 places:,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
LOCATION 1 FOR THIS UI TABLE GRID,,,,,,,,
"in the stellar chamber, under the pantheon tab",,,,,,,,
LOCATION 2 FOR THIS UI TABLE GRID,,,,,,,,
on a page at ?page=rup_pantheon_mar (if this page doesn't already exist please create it),,,,,,,,
