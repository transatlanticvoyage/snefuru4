please create a div that appears like a button and says
nubra tableface

it should have a border of 1 px solid with radius corners of 9 px 

the text should be 

we will name this
nubra-tableface-kite in our code somewhere for reference and then i will tell you which pages to add it to

mostly we will be looking at a lot of pages in the app that have a certain type of ui table grid on them and then i will be having you put this label there just above the top of the ui table grid on that page

background color should be 83e09d and text should be 16 px black with bold 

padding of div should be 5 px on all sides

you can start by adding this to the xpagesmanager1 page in the frontend ui then later i will feed you more pages
