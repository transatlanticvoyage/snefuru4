NEED PROMPT HERE FOR ADDING COLUMN PAGINATION IN GENERAL TO THESE PAGES

Please view the two button bars for “column pagination” on the kwjar page.

Implement two button bars like this on the /cnjar1 page.

Place them above the current two button bars for “row pagination” that already exist on the cnjar1 page.

Make sure they are styled the same as the button bars on the kwjar example page.

Ensure the system actively works to filter the UI table grid on the page using these column pagination options.

———————————————————————

please add these url parameters

cpag_qty
cpag_spec

these should be on /kwjar page

they should apply to the column pagination system

this way user can visit url that already has the same settings active

the first one means "qty" of columns per page (applies to first column pagination button bar)

the second one means "spec" or "specific" page in the column pagination selected (applies to second button bar on our page for column pagination)


==========================================================
============== SEPARATOR =================================
==========================================================

please do the following on our page at:
/cnjar1

I want the following UI columns to be excluded from the normal column pagination:

cncg_id
cities->city_name
cities->state_code
industries->industry_name


We already have the checkbox column, which is presumably excluded in this manner.

So now we should have the checkbox plus the other UI columns listed above always appearing at the far left of the table.

Then, the column pagination settings should apply only to the other columns that are not in this list.

In effect, I’m trying to create “sticky columns” that represent the core identity of each row. Currently, only the checkbox column always appears this way, but I want all of these important columns to appear in the same way.

No matter what column pagination setting is selected by the user, these columns will always remain visible on the left of the table, while the pagination controls switch the other columns to the right.


———————————————————————
SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT DUPLICATE LISTING COLUMNS:
this ui table grid that we are working on on page of /cnjar1 has many columns that have "duplicate instances"

in the list of columns above in this prompt, i am only referring to the versions that occur to the "farthest left" in the ui table. I'm not referring to the other versions that occur "later" or farther to the right in the table

of course, im referring to these columns:
cities->city_name
cities->state_code
industries->industry_name

the "sticky" versions are the versions that should be excluded from the main column pagination system

only the first versions (the versions that occur farthest left in the table) are the ones that should be "excluded" like this as "sticky columns"

the other instances of these columns that appear later (farther to the right) in the table should be included in the column pagination system (not excluded)


==========================================================
============== SEPARATOR =================================
==========================================================


please alter the main ui table grid on the page at /driggsman so that the <table> element is not taking up 100% the width of its parent

the table should only take up the width of its contents (columns)

also please make sure each ui column is only taking up enough space to hold its contents (it may already be configured like this - I'm not sure)


==========================================================
============== SEPARATOR =================================
==========================================================

 please add url parameters to the cnjar1 page for each of the 3 dropdown filters that pertain to the main  │
│   ui table grid on the page                                                                                 │
│                                                                                                             │
│   this way user will be able to come back to specific options with a url link and have that state of hte    │
│   screen already loaded



==========================================================
============== SEPARATOR =================================
==========================================================

please view the /cnjar1 page and study the "show page header/hide page header" button that shows there

please imlement the same type of button on the page at:
/driggsman

please make sure that the default setting is for the page header to be hidden

important term for this ui element:
callout arrow
tooltip arrow
pointer
caret



> we need a popup that is custom and special. when user clicks on the zz1, zz2, zz3 cells, a
  popup should open extending to the right from the exact point that they clicked on (not
  exact point - but i meant "exact cell" that they clicked on)

  there should be a triangular looking ui element visually "joining" the table cell that they
   clicked on. this triangular piece should basically come to a point as it contacts the
  right edge of the table cell they clicked on. this triangle piece should exten horizontally
   for 10 px before the left edge of the popup begins.please also let me know what this kind
  of triangular ui element is known as. its purpose is to visually join the popup to the
  element that its triggered from. the poopup itself should be 100% the height of the user's
  browser and 840 px wide

  in the popup right now, do not put any content, other than a piece of text at the top left
  in 16 px bold that says zz1 or zz2 or zz3 (depending on which popup version it is - there
  will be 3 different versions right now (1 for each driggspack))
