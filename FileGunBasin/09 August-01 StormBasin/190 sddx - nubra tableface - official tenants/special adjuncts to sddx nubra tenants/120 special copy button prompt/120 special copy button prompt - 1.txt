│   the "button" is just a square div (do not use an actual button element)                                            │
│                                                                                                                      │
│   the div is a copy button that will copy the shortcode of every field for that specific row and field               │
│                                                                                                                      │
│   this div button will be 30 px wide and it will span the entire height of the table row (table td cell) that it     │
│   sits inside of                                                                                                     │

│   the div button will appear anytime the user hovers anywhere over the <td> that it resides in                       │
│                                                                                                                      │
│   the div button will have a 1px solid gray border and will appear compltely rectangular                             │
│                                                                                                                      │
│   the div button will sit at the exact right edge of the <td> that it resides inside with no gap between its edge    │
│   and the right border of that <td>                                                                                  │

│   when the div button appears (upon user hover of the parent <td>), it should not cause any visual shift in the      │
│   look of the ui table grid to the user regarding the widths of each column                                          │

│   the button should most likely use absolute positioning to hug the right side of the <td> while overriding          │
│   (appearing above /covering) the other contents of the ui table cell (by having a higher z index)                   │
│                                                                                                                      │
│   when user hovers directly over the copy button div itself, there should be a yellow bg color of the div            │
│                                                                                                                      │
