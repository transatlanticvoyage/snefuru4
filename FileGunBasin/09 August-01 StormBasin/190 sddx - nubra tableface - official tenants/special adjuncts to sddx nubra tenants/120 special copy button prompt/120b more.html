please alter the shortcode copy button areas (on both pages in our plugin) in the following ways:

  make the button only 10 px wide

  make the buttons always present

  remove any complex code about show/hide in different user cursor states, etc. (just show the buttons as always
  present)

  reduce the "sh" font size to 11 px
