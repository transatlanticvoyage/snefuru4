> we need a popup that is custom and special. when user clicks on the zz1, zz2, zz3 cells, a
  popup should open extending to the right from the exact point that they clicked on (not
  exact point - but i meant "exact cell" that they clicked on)

  there should be a triangular looking ui element visually "joining" the table cell that they
   clicked on. this triangular piece should basically come to a point as it contacts the
  right edge of the table cell they clicked on. this triangle piece should exten horizontally
   for 10 px before the left edge of the popup begins.please also let me know what this kind
  of triangular ui element is known as. its purpose is to visually join the popup to the
  element that its triggered from. the poopup itself should be 100% the height of the user's
  browser and 840 px wide

  in the popup right now, do not put any content, other than a piece of text at the top left
  in 16 px bold that says zz1 or zz2 or zz3 (depending on which popup version it is - there
  will be 3 different versions right now (1 for each driggspack))
==========================================================

Perfect! I have successfully implemented the custom popup system with the triangular
  connector. Here's a summary of what I've created:

  Custom Popup Implementation Summary

  What is the triangular UI element called?

  The triangular element is commonly called a "callout arrow", "pointer", "caret", or
  "tooltip arrow". In UI/UX design, this pattern is used to create visual continuity between
  a trigger element and its associated popup/tooltip.

  Implementation Features:

  1. State Management:
	- Added driggspackPopup state to track which popup is open, its position, and associated
  site ID
	- Includes popup type ('zz1', 'zz2', 'zz3'), position coordinates, and site ID
  2. Click Handlers:
	- Updated all three zz1/zz2/zz3 cells to use handleDriggspackClick(e, type, siteId)
	- Captures the exact cell position using getBoundingClientRect()
	- Positions popup to extend from the right edge of the clicked cell
  3. Popup Structure:
	- Backdrop: Semi-transparent overlay that closes popup when clicked
	- Main Container: Fixed positioned popup (840px wide, 100% height)
	- Triangular Connector: Positioned 10px to the left of the popup, visually connecting to
  the clicked cell
	- Content Area: Scrollable content area with 16px bold header showing the popup type
  4. Positioning:
	- Popup appears exactly at the vertical position of the clicked cell
	- Extends horizontally 10px from the right edge of the cell (for the triangle)
	- Triangle is a rotated square with borders creating the pointed appearance
  5. Styling:
	- Clean white background with shadow and border
	- Triangle matches the popup's border styling
	- Responsive height (100% of browser viewport)
	- Z-index layering for proper stacking
  6. Interaction:
	- Click on zz1/zz2/zz3 opens respective popup
	- Click on backdrop closes popup
	- Each popup displays its corresponding identifier (zz1, zz2, or zz3)

  The implementation provides a professional-looking popup system with visual connection to
  the trigger elements, ready for additional content to be added to each popup variant.
