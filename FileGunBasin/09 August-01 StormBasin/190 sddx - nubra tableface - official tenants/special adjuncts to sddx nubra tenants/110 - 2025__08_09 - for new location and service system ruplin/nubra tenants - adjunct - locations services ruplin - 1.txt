on our wp plugin page at
  page=rup_locations_mar

  please add a new ui column to the right of our existing ui column by name of
  rel_image1_id

  the new column should have the name of:
  pick image1

  please write it in bolder, all lowercase, exactly as above, with the space included

  in the actual <td> section of the table, under this new ui column, please create some type of widget that the
  user can click on. please create a button that says:
  choose image

  if an image is already assigned, then show the image (but constrain it to a max of 30 px height and 200 px
  width), and also show a button to the left of the image that says "assign new image"

  when user clicks on this button, they will be able to change the assigned image

  ———————————————————————
  special note about what this feature does:
  this updates the db field
  rel_image1_id to hold the id number of a specific image that has already been uploaded to the media library
