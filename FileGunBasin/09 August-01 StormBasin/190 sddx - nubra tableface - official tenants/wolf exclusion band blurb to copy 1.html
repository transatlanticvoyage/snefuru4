pleaes add a black 3 px vertical separator to the right side of the fk_address_glub_id ui   │
│   column in the table (this can be a border) . then please modify the table so that the       │
│   checkbox plus addresspren_id, address_label, fk_addressglub_id are "excluded" from the      │
│   column pagination system (they are "sticky" - and now the column pagination system will     │
│   filter columns only to the right of these defined ui columns(sticky) which are part of      │
│   what we call the WolfExclusionBand - this is a band of columns that is excluded from the    │
│   normal column pagination controls)
