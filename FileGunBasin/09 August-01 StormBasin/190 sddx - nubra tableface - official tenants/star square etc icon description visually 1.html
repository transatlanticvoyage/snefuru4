we must update the display and behavior of each ui column for the org entities in our /addressjar system


  ———————————————————————
  DESIRED THINGS



  when blank/unchecked by user:

  each shape must contain only a border outline visually, and no fill color internally

  when filled/checked by user:
  each shape must contain a solid dark red color and a gray 1 px border around the outside of its shape

  the same gray 1 px border is what should be showing around the edge of the icon when it is unchecked(this border
  element should not be "new" based on checked/unchecked state)

  ADJUNCTIVE PIECE
  
  please make the "all function work" when user clicks the shape icons for the org entities in the cell of <th> .  │
  │   make it mark "all" items in the current pagination with the associated organization entity. similar to "select   │
  │   all" in concept.
