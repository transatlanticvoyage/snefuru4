please replace this text on the /filegun page:

r22 - mead function - create new folder (and sometimes a file) in numbered convention

with the new text:

.mead-lake

make it bold

add a tooltip icon to the right of this text and when hovered, the little tooltip popup should say:
r22 - mead function - create new folder (and sometimes a file) in numbered convention

there should also be a 1 click copy button in the tooltip popup so user can copy this text
