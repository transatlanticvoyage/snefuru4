note: this button must be grayed out/unavailable unless a specific keyword_id paramater is set in the url

here is how function should work:

look through the zhe_serp_results (the top 100 that show in the table from the active kw selection)

and look at the k_root_domain column

side note:

please create new button in orange bg color to right of the complete pending fetch button taht says                

run f410 stamp emd match 1                                                                                                                                                                                                      
when user clicks this, the following function will be run:                                                     

(we must add new db field called k_root_domain to db table zhe_serp_results)



please issue sql for this with field type of text

then create some type of trigger or automatic process that any time a new db row is created and there is a value in field "domain" in zhe_serp_results, run a parse or extraction process that does the following:

extracts the root domain

so if "domain" column holds value "www.dogs.com"

then the k_root_domain column becomes "dogs.com"

and "parsons.jarls.cats.com" becomes "cats.com" in our new column

(so all subdomains must be removed - we must accurately get a list of current domain extensions or have a way to know how to do this accurately because there are many weird domain extensions like .co.nz , .net.za, etc. and we don't want our system not understandign that those are not a root domain themselves but rather a multi-part domain extension)

———————————————————————


continuing on with our previous function from above

the system must look at these 2 db columns and their values:

industries.emd_stamp_slug
cities.city_name

as
