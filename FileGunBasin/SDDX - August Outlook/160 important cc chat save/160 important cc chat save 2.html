	- Most applications don't reference constraint names directly
	- The actual table/column names aren't changing, just the internal constraint/index names
  4. Risk assessment:
	- Low risk: Index renames (applications don't usually reference index names)
	- Medium risk: Constraint renames (some applications might reference constraint names in error
  handling or schema introspection)

  I'll propose a methodical strategy that minimizes potential system disruption. Start by renaming
  indexes, which carries the lowest risk. Conduct comprehensive application testing after each rename to
  ensure system stability. Only proceed with constraint renaming if initial tests pass successfully. This
  incremental approach protects the fully functional coltemp system while addressing the naming concerns.

⏺ You're absolutely right to be cautious! The coltemp system being fully functional means we need to be
  very careful. Here's my assessment of the work involved:

  Risk Assessment:

  LOW RISK (Indexes):
  - Index renames are generally safe since applications rarely reference index names directly
  - Database performance remains the same
  - Can be done with simple ALTER INDEX commands

  MEDIUM RISK (Constraints):
  - Constraint renames are trickier because some applications might reference constraint names in:
	- Error handling code (catching specific constraint violation errors)
	- Schema introspection queries
	- Database migration scripts

  My Recommendation:

  Option 1: Leave them as-is for now
  - Since the coltemp system works perfectly, don't fix what isn't broken
  - The "denbu" names are just internal schema object names, not user-facing
  - Focus on getting your new tables (yegdbc, rackuic, zugdbt) created with clean names

  Option 2: Gradual, safe approach (if you really want to clean them up):
  1. Start with just the indexes (safer)
  2. Test thoroughly after each change
  3. Have a rollback plan ready

  Suggested replacement name: Use "rackuic" instead of "denbu" to match your new naming convention.

  What's your preference? I'd lean toward Option 1 - leave the working coltemp system alone and focus on
  the new tables with clean names.

> i just wanted to tell you that were are going to be renaming the current rack db table and renaming some
   field inside it

  but we are still in planning

  im trying to feed you all this info so you get the full picture of what were doing with all this db
  stuff

⏺ Got it! I understand you're giving me the full picture of your database restructuring plan. So far I
  have:

  Current Planning Status:
  1. ✅ Already deleted: zug_tables and yeg_columns (completed)
  2. 📋 New tables to create:
	- yegdbc (from old yeg_columns) - SQL ready
	- rackuic (from old rackui_columns) - SQL ready
	- zugdbt (from old zug_tables) - SQL ready
  3. 🔄 Still coming: Renaming current rackui_columns table and some of its fields

  Current situation with "denbu" references:
  - Found in existing rackui_columns, coltemps, and coltemp_rackui_relations tables
  - Keeping as-is for now since coltemp system is working

  I'm ready for the next piece of the puzzle - the renaming plan for the current rackui_columns table.
  This will help me understand how all these pieces fit together in your overall database restructuring.

⏺ Full SQL for rackui_columns → rackuic Transformation

  -- Step 1: Create new rackuic table
  CREATE TABLE public.rackuic (
	rcolumn_id SERIAL NOT NULL,
	rel_utg_id VARCHAR NULL,
	rcolumn_name TEXT NOT NULL,
	display_name TEXT NOT NULL,
	data_type TEXT NOT NULL,
	is_available BOOLEAN NULL DEFAULT TRUE,

	is_sortable BOOLEAN NULL DEFAULT TRUE,
	is_searchable BOOLEAN NULL DEFAULT TRUE,
	is_editable BOOLEAN NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
	column_group VARCHAR(50) NULL,
	source_table VARCHAR(100) NULL,
	cached_coltemp_ids TEXT[] NULL,

	CONSTRAINT rackuic_pkey PRIMARY KEY (rcolumn_id),
	CONSTRAINT rackuic_rel_utg_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (rel_utg_id) REFERENCES utgs (utg_id) ON DELETE
  CASCADE,
	CONSTRAINT rackuic_user_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
	CONSTRAINT rackuic_data_type_check CHECK (
	  data_type = ANY (ARRAY['text'::text, 'number'::text, 'boolean'::text, 'json'::text,
  'timestamp'::text, 'uuid'::text])
	)
  );

  -- Step 2: Create indexes
  CREATE INDEX idx_rackuic_rel_utg_id ON public.rackuic USING btree (rel_utg_id);
  CREATE INDEX idx_rackuic_user_id ON public.rackuic USING btree (user_id);
  CREATE INDEX idx_rackuic_is_available ON public.rackuic USING btree (is_available);
  CREATE INDEX idx_rackuic_cached_coltemp_ids ON public.rackuic USING gin (cached_coltemp_ids);
  CREATE INDEX idx_rackuic_default_position ON public.rackuic USING btree (default_position);

  -- Step 3: Create trigger
  CREATE TRIGGER update_rackuic_updated_at BEFORE UPDATE ON rackuic FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION
  update_updated_at_column();

  -- Step 4: Migrate data with field name changes
  INSERT INTO public.rackuic (
	rcolumn_id, rel_utg_id, rcolumn_name, display_name, data_type, is_available,
	default_position, created_at, updated_at, rcolumn_width, user_id, is_sortable,
	is_searchable, is_editable, column_group, source_table, cached_coltemp_ids
  )
  SELECT
	column_id, rel_utg_id, column_name, display_name, data_type, is_available,
	default_position, created_at, updated_at, rackuicol_width, user_id, is_sortable,
	is_searchable, is_editable, column_group, source_table, cached_coltemp_ids
  FROM public.rackui_columns;

  -- Step 5: Drop old table (AFTER application updates)
  -- DROP TABLE public.rackui_columns CASCADE;

  Scope of Work Estimate

  HIGH COMPLEXITY - This is a major change because:

  1. Database Changes (Medium Risk)

  - Table rename: rackui_columns → rackuic
  - Field renames: column_id → rcolumn_id, column_name → rcolumn_name, rackuicol_width → rcolumn_width
  - All constraints, indexes, triggers need updating

  2. Application Code Changes (High Risk)

  Files that likely need updates:
  - /app/(protected)/admin/rackjar/ - entire directory
  - Any Supabase queries referencing rackui_columns
  - TypeScript interfaces defining the table structure
  - API endpoints using this table
  - Components displaying rack UI data

  3. Related Systems Impact

  - coltemp_rackui_relations table has foreign keys to rackui_columns
  - Need to update FK references: fk_denbu_column_id → fk_rcolumn_id

  4. Migration Strategy Needed

  Recommended approach:
  1. Create new rackuic table
  2. Update all application code to use new table/fields
  3. Migrate data
  4. Update foreign key relationships
  5. Drop old table

  Estimated Effort: 2-3 days of careful work with thorough testing

> the problem is we have active data in the existing db table thats being used by our app for admin
  functions such as rendering certain uis. does this change your perspective in what our ideal approach
  should be?

⏺ YES - This completely changes the approach! With active data being used for admin functions, we need a
  zero-downtime migration strategy.

  Revised Recommended Approach:

  Phase 1: Parallel Setup (Safe)

  1. Create new rackuic table alongside existing rackui_columns
  2. Copy all existing data to new table
  3. Set up triggers to keep both tables in sync during transition

  Phase 2: Application Migration (Gradual)

  1. Update application code piece by piece to use new table
  2. Test each component thoroughly before moving to next
  3. Both tables remain active during this phase

  Phase 3: Foreign Key Migration (Critical)

  1. Update coltemp_rackui_relations to reference new table
  2. This is the trickiest part - may need temporary dual-reference setup

  Phase 4: Cleanup (Final)

  1. Remove sync triggers
  2. Drop old rackui_columns table
  3. Clean up any remaining "denbu" references

  Alternative Approach: In-Place Rename (Riskier but faster)

  -- Rename table and columns in place
  ALTER TABLE rackui_columns RENAME TO rackuic;
  ALTER TABLE rackuic RENAME COLUMN column_id TO rcolumn_id;
  ALTER TABLE rackuic RENAME COLUMN column_name TO rcolumn_name;
  -- etc...

  Question: How critical is uptime for your admin functions? Can you afford a brief maintenance window, or
   do you need 100% uptime during the migration?

  This affects whether we go with the safer parallel approach or the faster in-place rename.

> i can afford a brief maintenance window and do not need 100% uptime. were still planning phase

⏺ Perfect! With a maintenance window available, we can use the in-place rename approach which is much
  simpler and faster.

  Recommended Strategy: In-Place Rename During Maintenance Window

  Phase 1: Pre-Maintenance (Application Updates)

  - Update all application code to use new table name (rackuic) and field names
  - Test thoroughly in development
  - Deploy application changes (code will temporarily fail until DB changes)

  Phase 2: Maintenance Window (5-10 minutes)

  -- Rename table
  ALTER TABLE rackui_columns RENAME TO rackuic;

  -- Rename columns
  ALTER TABLE rackuic RENAME COLUMN column_id TO rcolumn_id;
  ALTER TABLE rackuic RENAME COLUMN column_name TO rcolumn_name;
  ALTER TABLE rackuic RENAME COLUMN rackuicol_width TO rcolumn_width;

  -- Rename constraints (clean up "denbu" names)
  ALTER TABLE rackuic RENAME CONSTRAINT denbu_columns_pkey TO rackuic_pkey;
  -- ... etc for all constraints

  -- Update foreign key references in related tables
  ALTER TABLE coltemp_rackui_relations RENAME COLUMN fk_denbu_column_id TO fk_rcolumn_id;

  Phase 3: Post-Maintenance

  - Application comes back online with new names
  - Verify everything works
  - Clean up any remaining "denbu" references gradually

  Advantages:
  - ✅ No data migration needed
  - ✅ No sync complexity
  - ✅ Preserves all existing data and relationships
  - ✅ Much faster (minutes vs days)

  This approach work for you?

> ok let's proceed with this . tell me what sql i need to run

  i think the only files to change are in the fava system? can you please tell me what files and folders
  you will be working in? i want to verify it before confirming to proceed

✻ Thinking…

  The user wants to proceed with the in-place rename approach. They're asking for:
  1. The SQL to run for the maintenance window
  2. What files and folders I'll be working in to update the application code

  I need to be careful here because:
  1. They mentioned "fava system" - I should search for files that reference "rackui_columns" to
  understand what needs to be changed
  2. I should not assume where the files are - I need to search the codebase first
  3. They want to verify the files before confirming to proceed

  Let me use the Task tool to search for files that reference the old table name and field names.

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Provide SQL and identify files needing updates for rackui_columns to rackuic migration

✻ Thinking…

  I should search the codebase to find all files that reference the old table name and field names before
  proceeding. This will help me identify exactly what files need to be changed.

⏺ Task(Search for rackui_columns references)
  ⎿  Done (25 tool uses · 47.4k tokens · 2m 38.5s)

✻ Thinking…

  Great! Now I have a comprehensive list of all the files that need to be updated. Let me provide the SQL
  for the maintenance window and then list the specific files that need to be changed.

  The files are:
  1. /app/(protected)/admin/rackjar/components/RackuiColumnsTable.tsx - Main component
  2. /app/(protected)/admin/rackjar/page.tsx - Page component
  3. /app/(protected2)/fava/components/favaColumnVisibilityMatrix.tsx - Fava system
  4. /app/(protected2)/fava/components/favaColVisMatrixMaster.tsx - Fava system
  5. /app/(protected2)/torna3/page.tsx - Torna system
  6. /app/(protected)/admin/coltempcommand/page.tsx - Column template admin

  So it's not just the fava system - it's spread across multiple areas including the main rackjar admin,
  fava components, torna3, and coltempcommand.

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Provide SQL and identify files needing updates for rackui_columns to rackuic migration

  ALTER TABLE rackuic RENAME COLUMN column_id TO rcolumn_id;
  ALTER TABLE rackuic RENAME COLUMN column_name TO rcolumn_name;
  ALTER TABLE rackuic RENAME COLUMN rackuicol_width TO rcolumn_width;

  -- Step 3: Rename constraints (clean up "denbu" names)
  ALTER TABLE rackuic RENAME CONSTRAINT denbu_columns_pkey TO rackuic_pkey;
  ALTER TABLE rackuic RENAME CONSTRAINT denbu_columns_rel_utg_id_fkey TO rackuic_rel_utg_id_fkey;

  ALTER TABLE rackuic RENAME CONSTRAINT denbu_columns_data_type_check TO rackuic_data_type_check;

  -- Step 4: Rename indexes
  ALTER INDEX denbu_columns_pkey RENAME TO rackuic_pkey;
  ALTER INDEX idx_denbu_columns_rel_utg_id RENAME TO idx_rackuic_rel_utg_id;
  ALTER INDEX idx_denbu_columns_user_id RENAME TO idx_rackuic_user_id;
  ALTER INDEX idx_denbu_columns_is_available RENAME TO idx_rackuic_is_available;
  ALTER INDEX idx_denbu_columns_cached_coltemp_ids RENAME TO idx_rackuic_cached_coltemp_ids;
  ALTER INDEX idx_denbu_columns_default_position RENAME TO idx_rackuic_default_position;

  -- Step 5: Rename trigger
  DROP TRIGGER update_rackui_columns_updated_at ON rackuic;
  CREATE TRIGGER update_rackuic_updated_at BEFORE UPDATE ON rackuic FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION
  update_updated_at_column();

  Files I Need to Update

  NOT just fava system - it's spread across multiple areas:

  Main Rackjar Admin:

  - /app/(protected)/admin/rackjar/components/RackuiColumnsTable.tsx (main component)
  - /app/(protected)/admin/rackjar/page.tsx (page display)

  Fava System:

  - /app/(protected2)/fava/components/favaColumnVisibilityMatrix.tsx
  - /app/(protected2)/fava/components/favaColVisMatrixMaster.tsx

  Other Systems:

  - /app/(protected2)/torna3/page.tsx (table configuration)
  - /app/(protected)/admin/coltempcommand/page.tsx (column template admin)

  Total: 6 files across 4 different systems

  Do you want me to proceed with updating these files? The changes involve updating TypeScript interfaces,
   Supabase queries, and display text.

⏺ Based on my analysis, here are the specific UI columns and relationships:

  /coltempcommand Page UI Columns:

  Direct columns from coltemps table:

  - coltemp_id (primary key)
  - rel_utg_id
  - coltemp_name
  - coltemp_category
  - coltemp_display_name
  - is_default
  - button_text
  - tooltip_text
  - default_header_row_color
  - fk_user_id
  - coltemp_color
  - coltemp_icon (deprecated)
  - icon_name
  - icon_color
  - created_at
  - updated_at

  Special computed columns:

  - cached_rackui_count (stored in JSON) - Shows count from cached_rackui_json field
  - live_rackui_count (fetched from DB) - Real-time count from coltemp_rackui_relations table

  Key relationships:

  - The page fetches live counts by querying coltemp_rackui_relations table where fk_coltemp_id matches
  and is_visible = true
  - Has a button to run update_rackui_coltemp_cache function to refresh cached data

  /rackjar Page UI Columns:

  Direct columns from rackui_columns table:

  - column_id (primary key) → will become rcolumn_id
  - rel_utg_id
  - column_name → will become rcolumn_name
  - display_name
  - data_type
  - is_available
  - default_position
  - created_at
  - updated_at
  - rackuicol_width → will become rcolumn_width
  - user_id

  Important relationships:

  - Both pages reference the coltemp_rackui_relations junction table
  - This junction table has foreign keys:
	- fk_coltemp_id → references coltemps.coltemp_id
	- fk_denbu_column_id → references rackui_columns.column_id (needs to become fk_rcolumn_id)

  The migration will need to handle these relationships carefully to maintain the functionality of the
  coltemp system.

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Check for SQL functions and triggers related to rackui_columns and coltemp system

⏺ Based on the code I reviewed, here are the critical SQL functions and relationships that need careful
  handling:

  Critical Function Found:

  update_rackui_coltemp_cache - This is called from the /coltempcommand page and likely:
  - Updates the cached_rackui_json field in coltemps table
  - Counts relationships in coltemp_rackui_relations table
  - References rackui_columns table

  Potential Issues with Simple Rename:

  1. The RPC function update_rackui_coltemp_cache probably has hardcoded references to:
	- rackui_columns table name
	- column_id field name
	- fk_denbu_column_id in the junction table
  2. Foreign key cascades in coltemp_rackui_relations:
	- When we rename column_id → rcolumn_id, the FK constraint will break
	- The junction table's fk_denbu_column_id field needs to reference the new rcolumn_id
  3. Any database views that might reference these tables

  Recommended Approach - MORE CAREFUL:

  -- Step 1: Check what the cache function does
  SELECT prosrc
  FROM pg_proc
  WHERE proname = 'update_rackui_coltemp_cache';

  -- Step 2: Check for any views referencing the table
  SELECT viewname, definition
  FROM pg_views
  WHERE definition ILIKE '%rackui_columns%';

  -- Step 3: Check all foreign keys pointing TO rackui_columns
  SELECT
	  tc.table_name,
	  kcu.column_name,
	  ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name,
	  ccu.column_name AS foreign_column_name
  FROM information_schema.table_constraints AS tc
  JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu
	  ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
  JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu
	  ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
  WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY'
  AND ccu.table_name = 'rackui_columns';

  Should we run these investigation queries first before proceeding? This will help us understand the full
   scope of changes needed.

  thats what it said. please tell me how you think we should proceed . we are still in planning phase

✻ Thinking…

  Looking at the SQL function that was returned, this is a trigger function that updates cache fields.
  It's quite complex and has many hardcoded references to:

  1. rackui_columns table name
  2. column_id field name
  3. column_name field name
  4. fk_rackui_column_id in the junction table

  The function is doing:
  - Updating rackui_columns.cached_coltemp_ids
  - Updating coltemps.cached_rackui_count and cached_rackui_json
  - Building JSON objects with specific field names

  This is more complex than a simple rename. We need to update:
  1. The table name references
  2. The field name references
  3. The foreign key column name
  4. The JSON object keys (they're using 'column_id', 'column_name' which should probably become
  'rcolumn_id', 'rcolumn_name' for consistency)

  Also, there's a foreign key from coltemp_rackui_relations.fk_rackui_column_id pointing to
  rackui_columns.column_id.

  This is indeed quite involved and risky if the coltemp system is actively being used.

  The user has shown me a complex trigger function that has many hardcoded references. This changes
  everything about our migration strategy. Let me analyze what needs to be updated.

  ⎿  ☐ Analyze the complex trigger function and plan migration strategy

✻ Thinking…

  Looking at the prosrc function code, I can see:
  1. It's a trigger function that maintains cache consistency
  2. It references:
	- rackui_columns table
	- column_id field
	- column_name field
	- fk_rackui_column_id foreign key
	- JSON keys like 'column_id', 'column_name'

  This is definitely more complex than a simple rename. We need a comprehensive strategy.

⏺ Analysis of the Trigger Function

  This is much more complex than initially thought. The trigger function has extensive hardcoded
  references that maintain cache consistency between tables.

  What the Function Does:

  1. Updates rackui_columns.cached_coltemp_ids array
  2. Updates coltemps.cached_rackui_count and cached_rackui_json
  3. Builds JSON objects with specific field names like 'column_id', 'column_name'
  4. Maintains bidirectional cache between coltemps and rackui_columns

  All References That Need Updating:

  - Table: rackui_columns → rackuic (6 occurrences)
  - Field: column_id → rcolumn_id (6 occurrences in SQL + JSON keys)
  - Field: column_name → rcolumn_name (2 occurrences in JSON)
  - FK: fk_rackui_column_id → fk_rcolumn_id (8 occurrences)

  Recommended Strategy - TWO OPTIONS:

  Option A: Complete Migration (Riskier but Cleaner)

  1. Create new function with all updated references
  2. During maintenance window:
	- Drop old trigger
	- Rename table and columns
	- Update foreign keys
	- Create new trigger with updated function
	- Update all application code

  Option B: Keep Internal Names (Safer)

  1. Only rename the table rackui_columns → rackuic
  2. Keep all column names the same internally
  3. This minimizes changes to the complex trigger function
  4. Update only application code to use new table name

  My recommendation: Given the complexity and that the coltemp system is actively used, I suggest Option B
   - rename only the table, keep column names unchanged. This reduces risk significantly.

  Which approach do you prefer?

  ⎿  ☒ Analyze the complex trigger function and plan migration strategy

✻ Thinking…

  The user has to make a decision here about which approach to take. I've laid out the complexity and
  given them two clear options:

  1. Option A - Complete migration with all column renames (riskier)
  2. Option B - Only rename the table, keep column names (safer)

  I've made it clear that Option B is my recommendation given the active use of the coltemp system.

> in option b, you're proposing that we do not change the actual db column names themselves? (not just in
  filenames but in actual db )

⏺ Yes, exactly! In Option B, I'm proposing we do NOT change the actual database column names - only the
  table name.

  Option B Details:

  What Changes:

  - Table name only: rackui_columns → rackuic

  What Stays the Same:

  - All column names remain unchanged in the database:
	- column_id stays column_id (not changed to rcolumn_id)
	- column_name stays column_name (not changed to rcolumn_name)
	- rackuicol_width stays rackuicol_width (not changed to rcolumn_width)

  Why This is Safer:

  - The complex trigger function continues to work without any changes
  - Foreign keys in coltemp_rackui_relations continue to work
  - JSON field references in the cache remain valid
  - Only application code needs updating (table name references)

  Application Code Changes:

  // FROM this:
  .from('rackui_columns')

  // TO this:
  .from('rackuic')

  // But all field references stay the same:
  column_id, column_name, rackuicol_width // unchanged

  This means we abandon your original plan to rename the columns to rcolumn_id, rcolumn_name,
  rcolumn_width to minimize risk to the working coltemp system.

  Is this acceptable to you, or do you still want to proceed with renaming the columns as well?

> we must chnage the db column names. there is no way around this. but we are still in planning phase.
  please outline a broad level overview of everything we must do.

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Create comprehensive plan for full rackui_columns to rackuic migration with column renames

⏺ Comprehensive Migration Plan: rackui_columns → rackuic

  Phase 1: Pre-Migration Preparation

  1. Backup critical data
  2. Document current state (table structure, constraints, functions)
  3. Update all application code (6 files identified) to use new names
  4. Test application changes thoroughly in development

  Phase 2: Maintenance Window - Database Changes

  Step 1: Disable Triggers & Functions

  -- Drop the complex trigger that maintains cache consistency
  DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS [trigger_name] ON coltemp_rackui_relations;

  Step 2: Rename Table & Columns

  -- Rename table
  ALTER TABLE rackui_columns RENAME TO rackuic;

  -- Rename columns
  ALTER TABLE rackuic RENAME COLUMN column_id TO rcolumn_id;
  ALTER TABLE rackuic RENAME COLUMN column_name TO rcolumn_name;
  ALTER TABLE rackuic RENAME COLUMN rackuicol_width TO rcolumn_width;

  Step 3: Update Foreign Key References

  -- Update coltemp_rackui_relations table
  ALTER TABLE coltemp_rackui_relations RENAME COLUMN fk_rackui_column_id TO fk_rcolumn_id;

  -- Update foreign key constraint
  ALTER TABLE coltemp_rackui_relations
  DROP CONSTRAINT [old_fk_constraint_name];

  ALTER TABLE coltemp_rackui_relations
  ADD CONSTRAINT [new_fk_constraint_name]
  FOREIGN KEY (fk_rcolumn_id) REFERENCES rackuic (rcolumn_id);

  Step 4: Recreate Trigger Function

  -- Create new function with updated field names
  CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_coltemp_cache_trigger()
  RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
  BEGIN
	  -- All the trigger logic but with:
	  -- rackui_columns → rackuic
	  -- column_id → rcolumn_id
	  -- column_name → rcolumn_name
	  -- fk_rackui_column_id → fk_rcolumn_id
	  -- JSON keys updated: 'column_id' → 'rcolumn_id', etc.
  END;
  $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

  -- Recreate trigger
  CREATE TRIGGER [new_trigger_name]
  AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON coltemp_rackui_relations
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION update_coltemp_cache_trigger();

  Step 5: Update Constraints & Indexes

  -- Rename all constraints with "denbu" to use "rackuic"
  -- Update all index names

  Phase 3: Post-Migration

  1. Test cache refresh function (update_rackui_coltemp_cache)
  2. Verify all relationships work correctly
  3. Test coltemp system end-to-end
  4. Monitor for any errors in admin functions

  Phase 4: Files Requiring Updates (6 files)

  1. /app/(protected)/admin/rackjar/components/RackuiColumnsTable.tsx
  2. /app/(protected)/admin/rackjar/page.tsx
  3. /app/(protected2)/fava/components/favaColumnVisibilityMatrix.tsx
  4. /app/(protected2)/fava/components/favaColVisMatrixMaster.tsx
  5. /app/(protected2)/torna3/page.tsx
  6. /app/(protected)/admin/coltempcommand/page.tsx

  Risk Assessment: HIGH COMPLEXITY

  - Complex trigger function with 14+ field references to update
  - Bidirectional cache system that must remain functional
  - Foreign key relationships across multiple tables
  - JSON field mappings that must be updated

  Estimated Time: 4-6 hours with thorough testing
